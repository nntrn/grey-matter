[] We Begin Again

So Derek got dead, Mer and Cristina got old together, and Izzie showed
Denny her prom dress.

Such is the stuff of dreams. Which was kind of my theme. For this
episode. And this season. Dreams. And whether or not they come true.

This is season five, people. We, the writers, we call it our all in, go
for broke season. We're like the Chief -- the bar has been raised and
we're the ones raising it. For us, the show is new again. Full of
chances and possibilities. Our characters are new again, starting fresh.
We're hopeful again. And we're enjoying being hopeful. All the rules are
changing.

I know you are wondering, "Okay, what does this mean?" And I could tell
you. But I'd rather you watch and see for yourselves. Watch what happens
with Meredith and Derek, Cristina and that guy Owen, Callie and Erica,
Bailey, the Chief, George, Lexie, Mark, Izzie and Alex. All the clues
for this season are right there in this first episode. Nothing happens
without a reason. Every line of dialogue has a point. At least, I hope
it does. I'm pretty tired but I think I'm right.

That's all I'm going to say. Because we're shooting the eighth episode
right now. And I've got to get to the set to watch a scene being filmed.
So you'll have more to watch. I'll try to write more later.

Thanks for sticking with us. We're going to do our damnedest to make it
worth your while.

The bar has been raised, people. Consider yourselves on notice.
